                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>At Stroke Risk Assessment, our mission is to empower individuals with knowledge about their potential stroke risk. We believe that early awareness and understanding of risk factors can lead to proactive health management and ultimately contribute to a reduction in the incidence and impact of strokes.</p>
                <p>We strive to provide an accessible and user-friendly tool that leverages the power of machine learning to offer personalized risk assessments. Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex medical data and individual understanding, enabling informed decisions about health and well-being.</p>

                <h2>How Our Prediction Tool Works</h2>
                <p>Our stroke risk prediction tool utilizes a rigorously trained machine learning model. This model has been developed by analyzing a vast dataset of health information and stroke outcomes. By inputting key health indicators and lifestyle factors, our algorithm calculates a personalized risk score.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Our model is trained on a diverse dataset to identify patterns and correlations between various factors and the likelihood of stroke.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Importance:</strong> The model considers several crucial factors, including age, medical history (such as hypertension and heart disease), lifestyle choices (like smoking status), and physiological measurements (like glucose levels and BMI).</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Score Calculation:</strong> Based on the provided inputs and the learned patterns, the model generates a risk score that represents the estimated likelihood of experiencing a stroke.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informative Output:</strong> We present the risk score in a clear and understandable manner, along with explanations of the contributing factors to help users gain valuable insights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's important to remember that while our tool provides a valuable assessment, it should not replace professional medical advice. Consult with your healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized recommendations.</p>
